  "meaning": "A genuine, but sometimes secretive friend. He is logically oriented and a cunning planner. Although he can easily attain a partner, he usually tends to be a lone wolf because he doesn't believe in a frivolous relationship, and yearns for true love.

He is self-validated, and a risk taker, although his outward confidence hides a more vulnerable character. True Alex's won't be involved in activities like Football and Lacrosse, the ones who do are usually shorter and less comfortable with their masculinity. Due to their creativity and determination, Alex's are goal-oriented and work tirelessly to reach their long term mission. He loves having fun and will risk embarrassment for a good laugh. He never feels the need to drink or do drugs because he doesn't need them to enjoy life. Overall, Alex's are a constant source of laughs and are exceptionally loyal friends you'd be lucky to have.",

  "word": "American Idiot",
  "short_desc": "American Idiot (1) A 2004 [Green Day] album which serves as a rock opera that tells the story of a few average American youth living in a metropolis of rhetoric, lies, and censorship. The album tells the story, which takes place in the time span of about one year, through exploring the thoughts of each character as well as through dialog and interactions between the characters. While the plot is more of an abstract concept than it is a direct story, the message is fairly clear: the American youth remain unheard because of the &quot;I don&apos;t care&quot; attitude many of them carry, but because of the lack of actual dialogue, the root of this attitude is the fact that the American youth only know what they DON&apos;T want, and have never been presented with a reasonable option that they COULD want. Of course the ending of the story is, unfortunately, also an all-too-common reality in our current world.  The album/story also tells a typical teen-angst-style love story that applies a double meaning to the cover (which is a hand holding a heart-shaped grenade).  The album is expected to receive negative criticism (especially by those who don&apos;t take the time to truly understand the story or are too quick to judge and disregard it as &quot;left-wing propaganda&quot;), since it was considered a highly experimental concept from the very beginning. Others simply don&apos;t like it because of its difference from the typical Green Day style, but many see this as a refreshing and much-needed break. Love it or hate it, &quot;American Idiot&quot; is Green Day&apos;s first new release full-length album since 2002.  (2) The title track from the above-mentioned CD.",

  "meaning": "A rock band from Australia. It has been disputed exactly what genre of rock music AC/DC is, but wheather they're Classic Rock, Heavy Metal, Punk Rock, or whatever, AC/DC is one of the greatest rock bands of all time. AC/DC has been considered one of the founders of heavy metal, along with bands like KISS and Led Zeppelin. In 1974, AC/DC recruited lead singer Bon Scott, and released a string of LP's. In 1975, they released their first studio album (originally released in Australia only), titled 'High Voltage', followed by 'T.N.T' shortly thereafter. In 1976, they started to gain a little bit of international success, because of the release of 'High Voltage' and 'Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheep' in Europe and the U.S (actually, the U.S didn't see 'Dirty Deeds' in stores until 1981, but whatever). Finally, in 1977, they released their first international album, 'Let There Be Rock'. AC/DC enjoyed radio airply, high album sales, and high grossing tours, for quite some time. Unfortunately, shortly after the release of their 4th international album 'Highway To Hell', singer Bon Scott was found dead in the back of a friends car. He aperantly died because of a combination of Hypothermia, and choking on his own vomit (a popular trend among rock stars). Scott's friend, Ozzy Osbourne, wrote the often misinterpreted song, 'Suicide Solution' about the late singer. Later that year, AC/DC recruited a new singer, the infamous Brian Johnson. They released 'Back In Black' in late 1980. It is now the 5th highest grossing album of all time-selling 21,000,000 copies in the US alone. This was because of the ever popular singles 'Back In Black' and 'You Shook Me All Night Long'. AC/DC continues to release popular albums today, and retains a vast fanbase, even through all of the changes the music industry has endured.",

Agnostics will often question the existence of a supreme power because a lot of modern religious beliefs have no basis in modern logic; therefore blind following of popular religions is viewed as an easy out for people who chose not to think for themselves.   Agnostics on atheism: On the other end of the spectrum, unlike atheists, an agnostic uses a more scientific approach to their belief system. An agnostic knows that just because there is no physical proof of the existence of a higher being, it dose not automatically mean that one does not exist. An agnostic views an atheist on the same plane as a religious zealot; often because the belief that human beings are the pinnacle of intelligence and there are few things that we do not or have the potential to understand.  The realization of knowing that \u201cwe cannot know everything\u201d is the backbone of the agnostic belief.",

Being the IRL pussy that he is, decided to hide his actions' persona behind true anonymity; in an undifferentiated gang of other sorry ass losers. Those actions more often that not, resulted in major lols, as expected of such fail IRL lolcows. Finally getting tired of being the laughing stock of the universe in all imaginable possible ways, they decided to better justified it and say that it was on purpose and hence forged a new inducive adage, that they 'did it for the lulz', or if with a sugarcoated moralfag anarchy twist, 'for great justice'. Which is either way pointess and contradictory self-pwning anyhow. They're also closet attention whores that get their kicks of unwarranted self-importance by vandalizing real attention whores' shit and people who disagree with them; since most people are not major geeks, just could not emotionally get it, and are hence labeled anti-lulz; the real attention whores were of course asking for it and deserve to get rape accordingly. Almost needless to say, intellectually that senseless shit of a ideological manifesto is just like them, laughable.

It is common knowledge that there's no oldanon, it just remains constant the same plain old shitty level of anon crap; the real oldanon left the scene when they weren't any more real challenges or grew up. It is useless to increase the quantity of them by dynamically recruiting fucktards, since they are all unreliable retarded rap-loving 13 year old boys newfag emo furry shit.

With regard to the breaks between plays in football, there&apos;s a purpose other than giving the big guys on the lines a break (and by big, I mean 300+ pounds...). American football is a game of set plays and tends to get very complex with all the terminology and the amount of plays you have to memorize (most coaches script anywhere from 150 to 250 possible plays per game). Granted, rugby is more fast paced and the plays are more oriented to the flow of the game which makes it pretty exciting to watch and challenging to play.

Today it is black-marketted by terrorist cells (mostly because the AK is easy to make). The AK-47 has been reported to have certain performances that surpass that of the Colt M16 series, and one reason is because the AK doesn&apos;t contain as many moving parts (therefore, maintenance is very easy).  The AK-47 can also brave any type of harsh condition and environment.  There are ALL kinds of variants to the AK-47: *AK-74 (5.45x39mm Soviet assault rifle) *AKS-74u (5.45x39mm Soviet carbine) *Saiga 12 (12g auto shotgun) *Dragunov SVD (7.62x39mm Soviet sniper/infantry-backup rifle) These 4 are just some.",

It has become the single most prolific weapon ever created, with models in use by military and police, or civilian consumers in nearly every country in the world. Chambered in the intermediate 7.62x39mm R.The AK-47 is best described as an amalgamation of several previous weapons designs. It has the Trigger, Double locking lugs, and unlocking raceway of the M1 Garand and M1 Carbine, the Safety mechanism of the John Browning designed Remington Model 8, and the layout and gas system of the StG-44.Versions of the AK-47 include the following:AK-47 Type 1/2(1948-1951) - Most rifles manufactured with a milled steel receiver.AK-47 Type 3(1952) - All rifles manufactured with a milled steel receiver.RPK - Handheld Automatic-Rifle variant with a longer barrel and a bipod.AKM - Modernized variant with various improvements over the AK-47.AK-74 series - Series of the AK-type rifle which replaced the AK-47 in 1978. Chambered in 5.45x39mmAK-101/AK-102/AK-103/AK-104 series - modernizations of the AK-74AK-107/AK-108 series - incorporates a balanced bolt group, reducing muzzle jump, vibrations, and felt recoil.",

Most people take her jokes lightly, and only worry sometimes. She tries to only trust a few people because she's scared of being attached and then being left alone. She knows she has friends who are always there for her, but she still thinks she has to fight her battles alone. She tends to have sudden periods of depression and pure sadness, where she smiles even though she's a second away from shattering. She fights for what she believes in and for everyone she loves. She can be a bit impulsive, but that's just her being silly. Her heart is fragile, and she loves all her friends. She would rather be in pain forever rather than watch one of her friends suffer. When she truly falls, she falls completely without looking back. She falls for the wrong guys and seems to always end up crying. She always puts too much faith in people and can be a little too forgiving and naive in her own ways.",

Negative atheists, while they don&apos;t believe in a god, do not positively assert that no gods exist.  Positive atheists, however, do.  2.) A person who believes that no god or gods exist.  Those who consider themselves atheists (who are usually positive atheists) tend to define &apos;atheist&apos; using the former definition, and those who believe in a god or gods tend to define &apos;atheist&apos; using the latter.  In both cases, this seems to be a demagogic practice intended to classify either as many or as few people as atheists as possible.  Negative atheists are usually referred to as [agnostic]s.  While neither definition of atheism entails any personality traits of atheists or of those who do believe in a god or gods (sometimes referred to as &apos;[theist]s&apos;), both atheists and theists tend to believe that certain traits apply to all atheists/theists.  Common myths about atheists include: all atheists are arrogant, immoral, rebellious, and/or intolerant; all atheists really believe in (the Christian) God and are simply in denial; all atheists are depressed and believe life is meaningless.  Common myths about theists include: all theists are naive and/or intolerant; all theists don&apos;t really believe in their god(s) and just pretend to because they&apos;re afraid that if people realised that no god exists, there will be complete chaos; all theists are weak and look to their god(s) for comfort.  It hardly needs to be said that while these myths apply to a select few individuals in each group, the claim that they apply to every atheist or every theist is false.  Negative atheists justify their lack of belief in god(s) by pointing out that no evidence exists for the existence of god(s), and justify their lack of disbelief by pointing out that no evidence exists for the nonexistence thereof.  Positive atheists often assert that while no evidence for god(s) exists, it should be by default assumed that they do not, until evidence is found.  Some also try to use [logic] to prove that God does not exist, but this is often attached by theists and weak atheists as being mere wordplay.  Some theists and weak atheists also assert that logic is superficial and meaningless (which is an easily refutable claim), and that only one&apos;s inner feelings can lead them to truth.  Some positive atheists (and [deist]s), however, are led to their stance through their feelings.  Some feel that because the world is filled with evil and malice, and all-loving, benevolent god cannot exist.  Those who are led to their stance through this feeling, however, cannot justify their disbelief in a malevolent god in the same way.  Some reject the idea of the Christian God because the [Bible] states that non-Christians are condemned to [Hell], and reject the idea as being too disturbing.

  "example": "\"Do you believe in God?\"\r\"No, I don't.\"\r\"Then you're an atheist?\"\r\"I suppose.  I don't believe God doesn't exist, so I could probably be called an agnostic instead.  Some atheists may consider me a 'negative atheist', though.\"\r\"Don't you think atheists.. er, would I call them 'positive atheists'?  Don't you think they're intolerant?\"\r\"Yes, you'd call them 'positive atheists', and no, I wouldn't say they're all intolerant.  While some may come off as arrogant, they're just unable to understand how you can believe in God; you probably come off as arrogant to them, also, because you're unable to understand how they can disbelieve in God.  People on both sides really need to make an effort to be more tolerant, and to discuss their stance on religion without using childish, immature insults.\"",

It&apos;s bad enough that AOL censors content and keeps track of what you see, now AOL wants to keep track of what you hear.   Any song downloaded from the AOL MusicNet service contains DRM (Digital Rights Management) software code embedded in it. DRM is used so AOL and the RIAA can identify which AOL member is downloading which songs. If you don&apos;t believe AOL and the RIAA keep track of what you are doing online, you are a n00b.

  "short_desc": "Aaron In India &quot;Aaron&quot; is a slang word for pimp.",
  "meaning": "A hardworking dude with a great sense of humor. Best known for finishing jobs with pizzazz and pride, breaking tension with jokes and puns, and communicating with astuteness and heart. Aaron also is a master of hospitality, knowing how to make people feel welcome.Some people see Aaron as cynical and jaded, and--to be fair--sometimes he is that. But under the surface is a beating heart that hopes and dreams, that sees beauty and light and feels deeply. Quick of wit and perception, Aaron is fun to talk with, and someone who provides thoughtful and stimulating conversation.Most of all, Aaron means someone who knows how to act according to his code of honor. He may not always voice his thoughts, but what he does say, he says because he thinks it right or funny, not to people please. He is a giver of compliments at times--not as a means of sucking up--but for the sake of making other people feel good. He is a warrior of heart, and acts from his heart.When life throws rough punches his way, he holds his footing, and keeps on going. He is loyal. One thing that holds him back is that he's been hurt and abandoned, and he struggles with trust and self-worth. But he is far more valuable than the finest precious metals or gemstones. One day he will realize his value and will know and receive the love and loyalty he has been craving. Til then, he suffers, believing the lies that he's not worth the effort and that he will always be alone and rejected.",
  "example": "\"If more people had heart, humor and hospitality like Aaron, the world would be a far better place.\"\"Aaron has a place in my heart forever. I love him dearly.\"",
